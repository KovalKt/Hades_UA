        Persephone: ...I spent many days tending this garden... or nights? Quite difficult to tell the time here. But, it's held on longer than I would have expected...
        Hades: ...Persephone... I...
        Persephone: Cerberus! I missed you so. And dutiful as ever, aren't you.
        Hades: ...I'm sorry. Know that I am sorry.
        Persephone: Hades... you look tired. Though, I am not the only one you ought to be apologizing to.
        Hades: I know. I know, I.... Why have you returned? If Olympus... if your mother discovers what happened, not even Zeus, not even {#DialogueItalicFormat}he {#PreviousFormat}could stop what would transpire, here!
        Persephone: {#DialogueItalicFormat}Oh{#PreviousFormat}, I've a thought or two about how we can settle that. Though I shall need for you and Zagreus to cooperate with me on a solution. Or, if you'd rather, I could just return the way I came?
        Hades: A solution? What, do you intend to have them over for Ambrosia? Not even you can fix a broken family, Persephone.
        Persephone: You're right, Hades! I can't. Certainly not by myself. So, are you going to help me, or what?
        Hades: ...I would do anything that you would ask of me.
        Persephone: Then, first, talk to your son.
        Hades: ...{#DialogueItalicFormat}Mm{#PreviousFormat}. Zagreus? You have already met Persephone, our Queen. I expect for you to show deference to her, at all times!
        Zagreus: Wow, Father, you called me by my name! What is this strange sensation that I feel? Perhaps it's this {#DialogueItalicFormat}deference {#PreviousFormat}of which you speak?
        Persephone: Oh, stop it, both of you. Don't make me regret this, Hades. Speak honestly with him. About yourself, not me. Go on.
        Hades: Yes. I... Zagreus. I know there have been times... when I've let my mood reflect on you. I showed very little patience. Questioned your judgment, often, when my own was flawed. Thus, I apologize to you, my son. I have no excuses. And I ask no forgiveness.
        Zagreus: What about the part where you lied to me about Mother, do you apologize for that? Your foul moods, and venting them on me... I've long since come to expect that from you. And I resented you for it. But I always thought... you're honest.
        Hades: Your mother did not come here willingly when we originally met. When she left... believing you were stillborn... her decision was final. I believed that she was better off without the lot of us, Olympus included. Deceiving both of you... it tore against my being. But it needed to be done.
        Zagreus: Well, you didn't need to vent all that inner turmoil onto me throughout my life. Though, I think I understand. I only wish I could have understood sooner. So, uh... what now? I've grown so used to ransacking your domain, I think I'm really going to miss it.
        Hades: About that... your {#DialogueItalicFormat}ransacking {#PreviousFormat}revealed many flaws in our security. The types that never get into reports. Our reputation rides on there being no escape from here. Would you... keep trying to break free? Not for my sake. But for this realm. For the Queen.
        Persephone: Zagreus... If you keep fighting out of here... it shall help keep appearances that everything is as it always was.
        Zagreus: Question, Father. Let's say I accept. When next I reach the surface... is it still going to be you waiting up there?
        Hades: Ah, boy. If you think for an instant that I shall go easier on you because of this, you'll soon learn otherwise.
        Zagreus: So I just battle to the surface and repeatedly kill my own father, then?
        Hades: You have it half-correct!
        Persephone: Perhaps you'll also tend to my little cottage while you're in the area? The garden doesn't take much care at all. I'd like to keep the place in decent shape. In case I cannot suffer this for long.
        Zagreus: {#DialogueItalicFormat}Hahaha{#PreviousFormat}, well! I guess I'll see what I can do.
        Persephone: Just do the best you can. And, clearly, I've work to do as well. We have a lot of it ahead of us, I'd say. So, shall we get started, then?
        Zagreus: {#DialogueItalicFormat}After all this time{#PreviousFormat}, it's only been a few days! But it's been good. Mother and Father are back together, made some new friends, got this fancy painting! Easy. All is well in the Underworld!

        Hades: Ah, boy. If you think for an instant that I shall go easier on you because of this, you'll soon learn otherwise.

        Hades: You have it half-correct!
        Persephone: Perhaps you'll also tend to my little cottage while you're in the area? The garden doesn't take much care at all. I'd like to keep the place in decent shape. In case I cannot suffer this for long.

        Zagreus: What about the part where you lied to me about Mother, do you apologize for that? Your foul moods, and venting them on me... I've long since come to expect that from you. And I resented you for it. But I always thought... you're honest.
        Hades: Your mother did not come here willingly when we originally met. When she left... believing you were stillborn... her decision was final. I believed that she was better off without the lot of us, Olympus included. Deceiving both of you... it tore against my being. But it needed to be done.

        Hades: ...I would do anything that you would ask of me.
        Persephone: Then, first, talk to your son.
        Hades: ...{#DialogueItalicFormat}Mm{#PreviousFormat}. Zagreus? You have already met Persephone, our Queen. I expect for you to show deference to her, at all times!

        Persephone: Oh, stop it, both of you. Don't make me regret this, Hades. Speak honestly with him. About yourself, not me. Go on.
        Hades: Yes. I... Zagreus. I know there have been times... when I've let my mood reflect on you. I showed very little patience. Questioned your judgment, often, when my own was flawed. Thus, I apologize to you, my son. I have no excuses. And I ask no forgiveness.
        Zagreus: What about the part where you lied to me about Mother, do you apologize for that? Your foul moods, and venting them on me... I've long since come to expect that from you. And I resented you for it. But I always thought... you're honest.
        Hades: Your mother did not come here willingly when we originally met. When she left... believing you were stillborn... her decision was final. I believed that she was better off without the lot of us, Olympus included. Deceiving both of you... it tore against my being. But it needed to be done.
        Zagreus: Well, you didn't need to vent all that inner turmoil onto me throughout my life. Though, I think I understand. I only wish I could have understood sooner. So, uh... what now? I've grown so used to ransacking your domain, I think I'm really going to miss it.
        Hades: About that... your {#DialogueItalicFormat}ransacking {#PreviousFormat}revealed many flaws in our security. The types that never get into reports. Our reputation rides on there being no escape from here. Would you... keep trying to break free? Not for my sake. But for this realm. For the Queen.
        Persephone: Zagreus... If you keep fighting out of here... it shall help keep appearances that everything is as it always was.
        Zagreus: Question, Father. Let's say I accept. When next I reach the surface... is it still going to be you waiting up there?
        Hades: Ah, boy. If you think for an instant that I shall go easier on you because of this, you'll soon learn otherwise.
        Zagreus: So I just battle to the surface and repeatedly kill my own father, then?
        Hades: You have it half-correct!
        Persephone: Perhaps you'll also tend to my little cottage while you're in the area? The garden doesn't take much care at all. I'd like to keep the place in decent shape. In case I cannot suffer this for long.
        Zagreus: {#DialogueItalicFormat}Hahaha{#PreviousFormat}, well! I guess I'll see what I can do.
        Persephone: Just do the best you can. And, clearly, I've work to do as well. We have a lot of it ahead of us, I'd say. So, shall we get started, then?
        Zagreus: {#DialogueItalicFormat}After all this time{#PreviousFormat}, it's only been a few days! But it's been good. Mother and Father are back together, made some new friends, got this fancy painting! Easy. All is well in the Underworld!

        Hades: ...I would do anything that you would ask of me.
        Persephone: Then, first, talk to your son.
        Hades: ...{#DialogueItalicFormat}Mm{#PreviousFormat}. Zagreus? You have already met Persephone, our Queen. I expect for you to show deference to her, at all times!
        Zagreus: Wow, Father, you called me by my name! What is this strange sensation that I feel? Perhaps it's this {#DialogueItalicFormat}deference {#PreviousFormat}of which you speak?
        Persephone: Oh, stop it, both of you. Don't make me regret this, Hades. Speak honestly with him. About yourself, not me. Go on.
        Hades: Yes. I... Zagreus. I know there have been times... when I've let my mood reflect on you. I showed very little patience. Questioned your judgment, often, when my own was flawed. Thus, I apologize to you, my son. I have no excuses. And I ask no forgiveness.
        Zagreus: What about the part where you lied to me about Mother, do you apologize for that? Your foul moods, and venting them on me... I've long since come to expect that from you. And I resented you for it. But I always thought... you're honest.
        Hades: Your mother did not come here willingly when we originally met. When she left... believing you were stillborn... her decision was final. I believed that she was better off without the lot of us, Olympus included. Deceiving both of you... it tore against my being. But it needed to be done.
        Zagreus: Well, you didn't need to vent all that inner turmoil onto me throughout my life. Though, I think I understand. I only wish I could have understood sooner. So, uh... what now? I've grown so used to ransacking your domain, I think I'm really going to miss it.
        Hades: About that... your {#DialogueItalicFormat}ransacking {#PreviousFormat}revealed many flaws in our security. The types that never get into reports. Our reputation rides on there being no escape from here. Would you... keep trying to break free? Not for my sake. But for this realm. For the Queen.
        Persephone: Zagreus... If you keep fighting out of here... it shall help keep appearances that everything is as it always was.
        Zagreus: Question, Father. Let's say I accept. When next I reach the surface... is it still going to be you waiting up there?
        Hades: Ah, boy. If you think for an instant that I shall go easier on you because of this, you'll soon learn otherwise.
        Zagreus: So I just battle to the surface and repeatedly kill my own father, then?
        Hades: You have it half-correct!
        Persephone: Perhaps you'll also tend to my little cottage while you're in the area? The garden doesn't take much care at all. I'd like to keep the place in decent shape. In case I cannot suffer this for long.
        Zagreus: {#DialogueItalicFormat}Hahaha{#PreviousFormat}, well! I guess I'll see what I can do.
        Persephone: Just do the best you can. And, clearly, I've work to do as well. We have a lot of it ahead of us, I'd say. So, shall we get started, then?
        Zagreus: {#DialogueItalicFormat}After all this time{#PreviousFormat}, it's only been a few days! But it's been good. Mother and Father are back together, made some new friends, got this fancy painting! Easy. All is well in the Underworld!
